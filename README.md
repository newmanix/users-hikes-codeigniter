# users-hikes-codeigniter
Example code for joining related Hikes model to existing Users model

Use the code here to augment an existing CodeIgniter application that has a Users MVC already in place.

The challenge here is to join the existing Users model to a related table, Hikes, which stores favorite hiking locations for users.

Users can add hikes, view hikes and delete any hike in the current iteration.  No session control is yet in place.
